Welcome to the early days of the tributors library! Here we want to provide an easy
tool that can help to automate or more easily generate metadata files for your
contributors.

<!--more-->

This means that we support creation and update of All-Contributors, Zenodo,
and (soon) Code Meta. You can use the tool on your local machine, within a container,
or via a GitHub Workflow. Check out the [getting started][getting-started] guide
to see how it works.
